Wisconsin breast cancer prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the use of machine learning techniques to predict whether tumors observed in data from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset are benign or malignant.

In this context, ANN is used as a predictive model that utilizes the observed features of the tumor (such as size, texture, and other parameters) as inputs to perform classification prediction. The ANN model learns from the training data to recognize complex patterns in these features and learns how best to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors.

The purpose of this model is to assist in the early identification of breast cancer by predicting the nature of the tumor from the observed data, which can then be used in further diagnosis and treatment efforts by medical personnel. By using ANN, it is expected to provide accurate predictions to facilitate early detection and better decision-making in dealing with breast cancer cases.
